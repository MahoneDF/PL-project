The codes for phase 2 are inside "/Project Files/Phase2/".
Each problem is written in a separate file named from P1.rkt to P5.rkt.
The actual codes (written in our own designed language) are defined as a string with the same name as the file.
For example, inside P1.rkt, there a string defined as p1, which is the actual code for problem 1, and you can simply run P1.rkt file to see if it is evaluated correctly.
There is a text file in Phase2 folder named InputGuide.txt, which contains instruction on how to set the inputs of each problem (since we don't have the ability to read the input from terminal).
The input placements are pretty clear from the files (inside main functions), but in case there is any confusion, please refer to InputGuide.txt.
