problem 1:
The input is the variable named n at the beginning of the main function. For testing, just change its value.

problem 2: 
At the beginning of the main function, there are two arrays defined as a and b. They hold the input and you have to manually set their size and 
each of their entries. The array named a corresponds to the first list, and the array named b corresponds to the second list (the one with binary representations).

problem 3:
The input is set at the beginning of the main function and is given as an array of strings of size 36 (instead of a 2D array of size 6).
The variable for the input is named board, and you have to set each of its 36 entries manually.
Note that entries 0 ot 5 correspond to the first row from left to right, entries 6 to 11 correspond to the second row, and so on.

problem 4:
At the beginning of main function, there is an array of strings named input.
You have to set the size of this array and each of its strings manually.

problem 5:
There are 5 arrays that store students informations: stdId, names, sirNames, stdAvg, stdMentored
The orientation is the same way as the example given in the doc.
Each student information has to be hardcoded in them. Hardcoded as setting each entry one by one. An example (same one as doc) is provided in the main.
Final answer is returned by findAnser function which gets the year as input.
