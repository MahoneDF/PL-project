# PL-Bonus-project

All implementation are with Kotlin.
The main functions for type checking are implemented inside Checker.kt.
There is also a file names Parser.kt for parsing the source code.
For testing, open Main.kt and replace the src variable with a desired testcase (Note that the code string is written between triple quotes followed by .trimIndent() method)
Please not that instead of ! for the unary not operation, we have used another syntax by using the keyword of "not". For example, instead of writing !x, you should write not x.
